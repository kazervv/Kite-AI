                <div class="testimonial fade-in">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">What it is: A digital passport that agents carry across platforms. It encodes their identity, permissions, and reputation.
                    Why it matters:
                    Today, an AI agent is just software. Anyone could spin one up and pretend to be someone else.
                    With an Agent Passport, you can prove an agent‚Äôs authenticity ‚Äî like a verified account for AI.
                    It also holds reputation (like a credit score), so bad actors can be filtered out, and trustworthy agents can earn status.
                    Analogy: Imagine every Uber driver had to carry a digital badge with driving history, reviews, and permissions. That‚Äôs what Agent Passport is for agents.</div>
                    <div class="testimonial-author">Agent Passport: Identity Layer</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="testimonial fade-in">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">What it is: A marketplace where agents can find services (APIs, data feeds, commerce stores, cloud functions, etc.) and pay for them automatically.
                    Why it matters:
                    Instead of humans wiring up APIs, agents themselves can discover services, negotiate access, and pay.
                    Think of it as the ‚ÄúApp Store for Agents,‚Äù but instead of apps for people, it‚Äôs services for AI agents.
                    Example: An e-commerce agent wants to compare shipping costs. It browses the App Store, finds a ‚Äúlogistics API,‚Äù pays a few cents to query it, and then makes a decision ‚Äî all without human involvement.</div>

                <div class="testimonial fade-in">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">What it is: Rules baked into an agent‚Äôs passport that define what it can or can‚Äôt do.
                    Why it matters:
                    You don‚Äôt want your shopping agent draining your wallet buying random NFTs.
                    Policies let you set guardrails: e.g., ‚Äúonly spend up to $100/day,‚Äù ‚Äúnever access adult content,‚Äù or ‚Äúonly transact with whitelisted merchants.‚Äù
                    Analogy: Like parental controls on a kid‚Äôs iPad ‚Äî but for autonomous agents.

                    <div class="testimonial-text">What it is: Built-in support for stablecoins (like USDC or PayPal‚Äôs PYUSD), so agents can pay each other instantly.
                    Why it matters:
                    Traditional payments (Visa, banks) aren‚Äôt built for microtransactions or machines paying machines.
                    Stablecoins give fast, cheap, programmable settlement, making it possible for agents to transact at scale without human intervention.
                    Example: Your research agent needs live market data. It pays 2¬¢ worth of stablecoin to a data provider every 10 minutes. Traditional systems would fail at that frequency/amount.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">What it is: Connectors to real businesses like Shopify and PayPal merchants.
                    Why it matters:
                    It‚Äôs not just theory. Merchants can opt in to be ‚Äúagent discoverable.‚Äù
                    Agents can shop at these stores, pay with stablecoins, and even trigger fulfillment automatically.
                    Example: You tell your shopping agent: ‚ÄúFind me the best deal on sneakers under $80.‚Äù It queries merchants, compares options, pays the winner, and schedules delivery ‚Äî no clicks required.</div>

                    Identity (Agent Passport) ensures agents can be trusted.
                    Discovery (App Store) lets them find and pay for services.
                    Rules (Policies) prevent abuse or mistakes.
                    Payments (Stablecoins) make it seamless.
                    Real-world integrations bridge to human businesses.
                    Together, this creates the Agentic Internet: a world where AI agents don‚Äôt just chat, but actually do business safely.</div>
